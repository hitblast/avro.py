## ⚡ Overview

**avro.py** provides a fully fledged, batteries-included text parser which can parse, reverse and even convert English Roman script into its phonetic equivalent (unicode) of Bengali. At its core, it implements an extensively modified version of the **Avro Phonetic Dictionary Search Library** by [Mehdi Hasan Khan](https://github.com/mugli).

> The original project ([pyAvroPhonetic](https://github.com/kaustavdm/pyAvroPhonetic)) can only be used on versions up to **Python 2.7** and doesn't contain proper support for Python's third major version AKA Python 3. It is noteworthy that Python 2 has officially been deprecated by the original maintainers and its usage is being discouraged overall. <br>

## ✨ Inspirations

This package is inspired from Rifat Nabi's jsAvroPhonetic library and derives from Kaustav Das Modak's pyAvroPhonetic. 

<br>

## 🔨 Installation

This package requires **Python 3.8 or higher** to be used inside your development environment.

```bash
# Install / upgrade.
$ pip install -U avro.py
```

<br>

## 🔖 Usage Guide

### 1. `parse()`
This is the most basic use case for avro.py, which includes parsing English Roman script to unicode Bengali:

```python
# Imports.
import avro

# Parsing some text.
output = avro.parse('ami banglay gan gai.')
print(output)
```

### 2. `parse(bijoy=True)`
Alternatively, we can generate the same output, but in compliance with the Bijoy Keyboard format:

```python
# Parsing some text in Bijoy!
output = avro.parse('tumi emon keno?', bijoy=True)
```

### 3. `to_bijoy()`
We can also use avro.py to convert existing unicode Bengali to its Bijoy Keyboard equivalent:

```python
# Converting some text.
bijoy_text = avro.to_bijoy('আমি বাংলায় গান গাই।')
```

### 4. `reverse()`
Finally, you can reverse unicode Bengali to English as well (newly added).

```python
# Reversing some text.
reversed_text = avro.reverse('আমার সোনার বাংলা।')
```

**Additional Developer Notes**

In short, avro.py doesn't depend on any third-party libraries. However, if you'd like to contribute to the project, you'll need a handful of such useful tools. <br>

- [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) - linter
- [pytest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest) - testing framework

```bash
# Installing the required developer toolchain.
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Running pytest.
$ python3 -m pytest --verbose

# The results should appear onwards.
# The --verbose / -v flag is used to show all the test results in detail.
```

### 🐛 We're looking for bug hunters, by the way!

If you come across any kind of bug or wanna request a feature, please let us know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/hitblast/avro.py/issues). We do need more ideas to keep the project alive and running, don't we? :P
